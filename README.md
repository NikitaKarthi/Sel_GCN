# Sel_GCN

This repository contains the supporting code for all the work that appears in the Sel_GCN paper. 

## Overview
Since the advent of computer networking, packet routing decisions have been extensively explored in academia. In today's deep learning era, the incorporation of neural networks into various supervised and unsupervised learning tasks has been proven highly successful. Packet routing is no exception to this assertion. Packet routing shares a similar structure to many autonomous control theory problems (such as maintaining the flight of a drone) and hence Reinforcement learning (RL) and Deep Q networks have been used before to assist in increasing **throughput** and decreasing **latency**, like in [2] by Modi et.al. Furthermore, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specially designed neural networks designed to operate over graphs, have also shown dominance in the field because networks are, in their fundamental form, graphs. Jiang et.al. in [1] have combined these two machine learning mechanisms to produce DGN: Deep Graph Neural networks. 

Our work is an extension of [1] and [2]. We implement Sel_GCN: An intelligent routing framework in multi-hop wireless networks. We complement the mentioned work by implementing selectivity at each agent using a distance heuristic to ensure that packets are routed even more efficiently, without circumnavigating/looping around the network. Our work is tested in a Jupyter notebook-based simulator.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.12.2 - This is the version used in the original work. You may choose to use an older version but please check for package version conflicts.
2. All the packages listed in [dependencies.txt](https://github.com/NikitaKarthi/Sel_GCN/blob/main/Sel_GCN_Dependencies.txt)
3. A CPU/GPU/TPU capable of training the models from scratch for several hours at a time, if you plan on doing so. (We do not recommend using a cloud computing platform like Google Colab unless you have a subscription that allows you to train models for >= 8 hours at a time as the kernel unexpectedly terminates otherwise.)
